## Section Header 1
Some paragraph text with **bolded text** and _italicized text_.

And some text with a [hyperlink](https://your-link-here.com).

Here is a list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Section Header 2

```
bin/build.sh &&
python3.9 -m src.app
```

This is a warning:
|WARNING title=Note: message=Avoid using this method just for lulz. It can be very dangerous opposite your daily fun stuff. WARNING|
